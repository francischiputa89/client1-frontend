                <p>
                    The Borrower hereby declares and warrants unto and in favour of the Lender that he/she
                    is gainfully employed that he/she is currently actively at work attending to all his/ her
                    normal duties on the date of signature of this Agreement and that the Borrower has
                    completed a period deemed appropriate by the Lender from time to time without absence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Borrower acknowledges that he/she has applied for a loan from the Lender in the
                    aforementioned amount by the Borrower.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Borrower acknowledges that he/she is lawfully indebted unto and in favour of the

                        <p>
                            Be reflected in an addendum, bearing a unique number, which shall be
                            executed by the Borrower.
                        </p>
                    </p>
                </p>

                    <p>
                        Until all monies and liabilities due or incurred by the Borrower to the Lender shall
                        have been paid or discharged, the Lender will hold a lien on the Borrower&#39;s
                        terminal benefits held by the Employer to the full satisfaction of the loan provided
                        by the Lender to the Borrower.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Deductions from the Borrower&#39;s salary shall be made on the due date, or any other date in
                    respect of other remuneration, each month commencing from the date reflected in the
                    Schedule until the whole amount payable by the Borrower to the Lender (inclusive of

                    member of staff of the Lender, and that in the event that cash is paid, it will be done so at
                    the Borrower&#39;s own risk should it turn out that the cash is not credited to the Borrower&#39;s
                    loan account.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Any latitude, extension of time or indulgence which may be allowed by the Lender to the
                    Borrower in respect of the Borrower&#39;s obligations in terms of and arising from this

                    the Lender, including debts ceded to the Lender. This set-off includes, but is not limited
                    to, actions where certain monies in excess of the original amount of the debt have been
                    collected by the Lender, but the Borrower is not in the position to claim a refund for such
                    monies as he/she is still indebted to the Lender in terms of other loan agreements entered
                    into by him/her with either the Lender and / or its subsidiaries and / or its cessionaries.
